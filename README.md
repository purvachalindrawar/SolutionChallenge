# ActionModule
## Description:
To create an engaging and interactive fitness experience that keeps users motivated and on track by providing real time, personalized feedback (on exercise form, techniques, calorie burn), progress tracking and gamified elements 

## Input=>
**User Input:**  ***Age, weight, height, gender, activity level, dietary restrictions, Weight loss, muscle gain, improved strength, increased flexibility, overall fitness improvement***
**Excecise/food related data:** ***Favorite activities, disliked activities, equipment availability, time constraints, desired intensity level, descriptions of meals or snacks, portion sizes, timing of meals.***

***video data: Live video stream for pose estimation***

**calories input**
***excercises tracking input data: Type of exercise, duration, intensity, estimated calorie burn,
Progress input data:  Weight changes, workout completion rates, achievement of goals
Previous sugggestions***

> (Extra Work)=> Local weather conditions to advise on appropriate outdoor workouts

## Output=> 
*** Suggested meals or snacks based on calorie budget, user preferences, and dietary restrictions.
Recipes or links to recipe databases with nutritional information.
Ingredient lists and portion sizes for recommended meals.
Personalized workout routines based on user fitness level, goals, preferences, and exercise data.
Estimated calorie burn for each exercise and the entire workout.
Adjustments to existing routines based on progress, feedback, and data analysis.
{Charts and graphs:} Visualize weight changes, workout completion rates, and goal achievement over time.
{Achievements and badges:} Recognize progress and milestones with digital rewards to keep users motivated.
{Comparison tables:} Show progress relative to personal best or community averages
{Motivational messages:} Personalized messages, quotes, or tips to encourage continued

> (Extra Work)=> Video demonstrations or detailed instructions for each exercise in the routine

## Functionality:
**1. Meal Planning**
{Suggest meals aligned with user goals weight loss, muscle gain and predicted calorie intake , Providing portion size suggestions based on individual needs and calorie goals}
**2. Real Time Feedback** 
{Utilize TensorFlow pose estimation (or your chosen model) to provide real-time feedback
 Track user performance metrics reps, sets, time.
 Integrate gamification elements like badges, streaks, or leaderboards}
**3. Excercise Routines**
{Generating dynamic routines based on user fitness level, progress, exercise preferences, and 
 real-time performance data 
 Provide a searchable library of exercises with clear instructions.
 Include rest days and active recovery suggestions }

 ## Technical Implementation
1. Programming Languages(javascript and python)
2. Libraries and frameworks
3. Integration
4. Testing
5. Deployment

# WorkFlow
1. Set fitness goals, preferences and dietary needs and restrictions in the app (done by user)
2. User logs meals throughout the day App analyzes user data and predicted calorie intake.
3. Action module suggests personalized meals aligning with goals, remaining calorie budget.
4. User chooses a goal-oriented routine or can creates a custom one.
5. Rest days and active recovery suggestions
6. User starts the workout with the option to enable pose estimation (camera).
7. Audio or text cues offer motivational prompts and Safety prompts highlight potential risks
8. Progress charts track weight changes, workout completion rates, and goal achievement over time.
9. Users can optionally share achievements and routines with the community
10. User feedback is collected and analyzed to refine recommendations, functionalities, and overall user experience.
11. The action module is continually updated with new features and improved accuracy based on data and user insights.

> Recommendation
> TensorFlow Lite's MoveNet model analyzes the video

> AlphaPose or detectron2 for more advanced pose recognition
 
> Matplotlib or OpenCV for displaying feedback overlays and visualizations.
